# Washington State Electric Vehicle Analysis

## Overview 
This project involves analyzing electric vehicle (EV) adoption in Washington State using a dataset from Kaggle. A comprehensive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and insights, including vehicle counts by type, make, model, county, and model year, as well as eligibility for clean alternative fuel vehicle (CAFV) incentives. 

The goal of this project is to provide insights into the current trends and distribution of electric vehicles across Washington State since 2011.
